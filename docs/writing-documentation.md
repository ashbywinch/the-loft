# Documentation Standard — what good documentation is

Standards for documentation quality — what good documentation looks like.
Separate from `docs/documentation-structure.md` (which mandates what docs
must exist and their folder structure). The `skill://write-documentation`
skill is the process that applies both.

## Skills are documentation

A skill (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) is documentation: it is a doc written
for the agent that loads it, and it is subject to every rule in this
standard — context efficiency, density, no-duplication, one topic per file
(a skill covers one task or procedure; a second task means a second skill),
the quality checklist, and the always-loaded size ceilings (a skill body is
loaded in full when used, so the 150–200 line / 32 KiB targets apply to it
directly). The review bot checks skill changes against this standard like
any other doc.

## Standards pair with their enforcement

A standard states the rule; something must operationalize it — a skill that
walks the procedure, an architecture test, a lint gate, or the review bot
reading these files. Writing a standard commits you to naming its enforcement
mechanism in the same change: a standard nothing enforces is a wish. A skill
that restates rules from a canonical document is a duplication finding — link
the canonical section instead; a standard with no skill or check behind it is
a finding at review.

## Context efficiency

Every documentation file contains only information relevant to its topic
and audience. Each doc has a single topic and a single audience. Content
that belongs to a different audience or topic goes in that doc, linked —
never copied in.

All documentation must be usable by humans or by AI agents; both navigate
from the entry point of AGENTS.md. Skills are exempt from the reachability
rule — a harness discovers them through its own mechanism (rationale and
scope in docs/documentation-structure.md).

## AGENTS.md is a bootloader, not an operating system

AGENTS.md loads everything else and gets out of the way. It holds the quick
start, the decision tree that routes every task to the right doc, and the
rules that apply to **every** agent in the repo — nothing more. Content that
only some agents need belongs in the doc the tree links to, never in
AGENTS.md itself. Test: is this genuinely relevant to 100% of agents
working in this repo? If not, it does not belong in the bootloader.

## Single source of truth — never duplicate

Each piece of information — whether documentation or code — lives in exactly
one place. Other docs link to it; they do not repeat it. A duplicated fact is
a finding: the copies drift, and the reader cannot tell which is current.

**Do not duplicate the code's job.** A doc that restates a function signature,
a default value, or a class structure is waste — the code is the source of
truth for those. Reference the code instead ("call `compute()`; see the
function docstring for the `Attempt` contract").

When tempted to copy content into a second doc, link instead — the link is
the duplication-free way to reuse.

**Good:** the development guide says "See the column reference for
details" and links to column-reference.md.

**Bad:** the development guide repeats the column layout inline — two
copies, one of which will go stale.

**Config snippets are code, not prose.** A block a tool would parse — a
workflow, a `.toml`/`.json`/`.yaml` snippet, an env-var table with literal
values — lives in a real `examples/` file (for skills:
`skill://<name>/examples/`), referenced by link, never inlined in a doc or
skill body. A real file is parsed, linted, and exercised like the shipped
artifact; an inline copy is not, and it drifts when the canonical copy
changes. If the file does not exist yet, create it — the doc references the
artifact, not a paraphrase of it.

**Good:** the gateway skill says "the working block lives in the sample:
`skill://new-repo-scaffold/examples/.pr_agent.toml` (the `[litellm]`
section)" — one copy, tooling-checked.

**Bad:** the same skill pastes `extra_headers = '{...}'` inline — a second,
unchecked copy that silently diverges (observed: the inline copy had a 5
minute timeout and no metadata while the sample had 10 minutes, metadata,
and backoff).

## One topic per file — the docs' separation of concerns

One reason to change per doc file, exactly as one reason to change per
module (docs/coding-standards.md 'Separation of concerns'): each doc
covers one topic for one audience. A doc with two audiences or two
unrelated topics is a finding — split it and link. A subtopic for a
different audience is a separate file that links back. The question
before writing or editing: "what single question does this doc answer?" —
a second question means a second file.

## Avoid redundancy

Before adding content to a doc, check whether it already exists elsewhere.
If it does, link to it. If it does not, put it in the most logical place
and link from the other docs.

## Delete, don't archive

Obsolete content is a liability. When something is no longer accurate,
delete it. Don't rename it "legacy", don't add a deprecation notice. If
it's wrong, remove it.

## Docs must match the code

When you rename a function, module, or tab, update the docs in the same
commit. Outdated docs are noise. Not every feature needs its own doc — a
well-named function with a clear signature and a readable implementation
is often its own best documentation. If the code is easy to read and the
interface helps users get it right, a separate doc may be redundant.

## Prefer automated tests and readable code over documentation

Where possible, write an automated test that proves the behaviour instead
of a doc that describes it. Prefer interfaces that make it easy to get right
(intuitive names, strict types, sensible defaults) over documenting how to
use them. The test is a living doc that fails when it lies; a written doc
stays green when it goes stale.

## No lectures on history

Never explain why a decision was made by describing the alternative that
failed and the person who made it. "It's a constraint inherited from X's
code" is a lecture. The reason is what matters; the history is noise. If
a reader needs to know why, state the constraint: "this message format is
required by the upstream API" — not "Bob chose this format in 2022 because
the old parser couldn't handle".

## API keys never go in docs

API keys, passwords, and secrets never appear in documentation or `.env`
files. They live in the shell environment only.

## Density & concision

Docs are read inside a limited AI context window; every sentence costs
context. Write for density: the smallest set of words that preserves every
fact and decision.

- **Rules as explicit negatives.** "Never X" reads faster and is followed
  more reliably than "be careful about X". (For instructions an agent must
  *act on* — a skill, a rule, a task prompt — see `skill://prompt-craft`.)
- **Commands over prose.** `make test` beats "run the test suite to verify
  everything works".
- **Tables over prose.** A rule per row beats a paragraph per rule, when a
  fact has consistent fields.
- **Canonical ✗/✓ examples over exhaustive enumeration.** One right/wrong
  pair teaches more than a list of edge cases; never enumerate every
  failure mode, show the pattern.
- **One-line contracts.** `compute()` MUST return an `Attempt` — prefer one
  line over three sentences.
- **Decision-relevant context only.** Keep only background that changes a
  decision; cut filler, restated motivation, and restated rules.
- **Size ceilings.** Always-loaded files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, skill
  bodies) target ~150–200 lines / <32 KiB — loaded in full every session,
  so bloat is paid every session. Referenced docs can be longer, but
  densify prose first.
- **Link, don't paste.** A fact lives in exactly one place; other docs link
  to it. References one level deep — a doc points to another doc, not
  through a chain.
- **Code in code files, not inline in docs.** A doc that contains a
  multi-line code block (config file, script, workflow) should move that
  code to a separate file and reference it. Inline snippets for
  illustration are fine (one-liners, key flags). Full config files and
  runnable scripts belong in `examples/` or `scripts/` directories, not
  in the doc body. Agents read the referenced files when they need them;
  the doc stays dense and doesn't duplicate the code's job.
- **Never reference machine-specific paths.** Docs must not contain paths
  that resolve only on the author's machine (`/home/<user>/…`,
  `~/Documents/…`, absolute user-folder paths). They break for every other
  reader and leak the author's home layout. Use repo-relative paths
  (`tools/foo.sh`) or a generic convention (`~/.local/bin/foo`) when the
  location is a convention, not a user folder.
- **Runnable code stays runnable.** A script or sample a doc references
  must exist in the repo at a resolvable path the reader can run from
  their checkout, and should be exercised by CI so it doesn't rot. Never
  document a runtime fetch-and-pipe of code from a remote URL (unpinned,
  unverified, breaks when the source moves); if remote fetching is
  unavoidable, pin a ref or checksum.
- **Task-shaped sections.** When a doc describes how to do something, use
  the task-card shape: goal (one verb), scope (exact paths), constraints
  (must / never), acceptance (verifiable command).

## The documentation-quality checklist

- [ ] Single, clearly stated audience
- [ ] Single, clearly stated topic
- [ ] No content that belongs to a different doc
- [ ] No duplicated content from other docs (link instead)
- [ ] Every section is relevant to the stated audience
- [ ] Title and first paragraph make the purpose clear
- [ ] Links to related docs where readers might need them
- [ ] Every sentence carries a fact, a decision, or a constraint
- [ ] Rules are explicit negatives ("Never X"), not vague preferences
- [ ] Commands replace descriptions where executable
- [ ] Tables replace paragraphs where fields are consistent
- [ ] Code shows a canonical ✗/✓ pair, not exhaustive cases
- [ ] Always-loaded files within the ~150–200 line ceiling

## The Loft's additions

- **The 150–200 line ceiling applies to docs generally; the canonical
  requirements document (`docs/PRD/PRD.md`) is the documented exception** — a
  requirements doc is one artifact, and splitting it would scatter the
  contract.

### Where things go

| Content | File |
|---|---|
| Product requirements | `PRD/PRD.md` |
| Architecture + decision record | `TECHSPEC.md` |
| The story-capture flow spec | `PRD/MEMORIES.md` |
| The artifact-import flow spec | `PRD/IMPORT-PRD.md` |
| Real-import lessons (worked example) | private — kept out of the public tree |
| Interview/discovery records + working drafts | `DISCOVERY.md`; session records stay private |
| Precedent research | `PRECEDENT.md` |
| UI / chat conventions | `UI.md`, `CHAT-UX.md` |
| UX loop working log | `PLAN/ux-fixes-plan.md` |
| Code/test/doc conventions | `coding-standards.md`, `testing-standards.md`, `writing-documentation.md` |

The routing tables in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are the find-it copies for
their audiences; this table is the canonical home for deciding where content
goes.

### Product-law phrasing (do not weaken)

- The app arranges evidence; it never interprets it.
- Nothing is asserted unreviewed (propose/confirm).
- No censorship by default; sensitive timing is a family decision.
