"""Called by .github/workflows/pr-agent.yml — fail the PR if the review bot
did not post a "PR Reviewer Guide" comment covering the head commit.
The review may have failed silently; this check prevents merging unreviewed.

A comment covers the head commit when its body references the commit's SHA
(the incremental-review form, "Starting from commit .../<SHA>") or it was
posted after the head commit landed (the first review on a PR is posted
without the SHA marker — observed: pr-agent v0.41.1 regular reviews never
contain the head SHA).

Why the bot's own step cannot fail (2026-08-11, read from the v0.41.1
source): ``PRAgent.handle_request`` catches EVERY exception with a bare
``except`` — it logs "Failed to process the command." plus the traceback
and returns False — and ``github_action_runner.py`` discards that return
value, so the action exits 0 whether or not the review happened. A green
bot step is therefore meaningless, and the only truthful signal is this
check. To make the failure SELF-EXPLAINING rather than a guess, the check
fetches the run's own log (the checks API) and extracts the bot's error
lines: the "Failed to process the command." traceback, model/API errors,
and the diff-token-cap marker — the check's failure message names the
reason instead of "may have failed silently".
